'''
    Gets the average rtt of a network trace file
    provided with the client and server IPv4 add.
    The average RTT is computed from the perspective
    of the client host.
    @PARAMS:
        filename        :   filename of the pcap/pcapng file
        client_ip       :   IPv4 address of the client host
        server_ip       :   IPv4 address of the server host
        baseline_rtt    :   the baseline RTT to compare the value of
                            the average RTT with

    @RETURNS:
        average_rtt     :   average round trip time of packets matched
                            on a SEQ-ACK number condition
        buffer_delay    :   the increase in RTT from the throughput
                            test compared with the computed baseline
